## VLC 4.0 Project
VLC 4.0 introduces a modern Qt interface that enhances usability while maintaining the familiar experience users love. This update brings a fresh look, making interaction smoother for billions of users worldwide. VLC remains a versatile, open-source multimedia engine, offering broad compatibility across platforms and devices, making it a top choice for media playback.

### VLC Qt Interface 
The VLC 4.0 Qt interface brings a sleek, modern design that enhances usability and visual appeal. Prioritizing clarity and ease of use, this interface offers an intuitive experience. Its versatility shines across both Windows and GNU/Linux, providing consistent multimedia performance and accessibility for users on various platforms.
 
The video section is a modern design with quick access to recently watched content, making navigation easy.

### ðŸ“Œ May 1 - May 26 : Community Bonding Period
During the community bonding period, I actively engaged with mentors, senior members, and fellow contributors to learn more about their projects and working domains within VLC. I also resumed contributions to the VLC Qt Interface and dedicated time to exploring and learning [GammaRay](https://github.com/KDAB/GammaRay) (a powerful tool developed by KDAB for inspecting and debugging Qt applications) and its features. This interaction and learning laid a strong foundation for my GSoC journey.
