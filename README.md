### ðŸ“Œ May 1 - May 26 : Community Bonding Period
During the community bonding period, I actively engaged with mentors, senior members, and fellow contributors to learn more about their projects and working domains within VLC. I also resumed contributions to the VLC Qt Interface and dedicated time to exploring and learning [GammaRay](https://github.com/KDAB/GammaRay) (a powerful tool developed by KDAB for inspecting and debugging Qt applications) and its features. This interaction and learning laid a strong foundation for my GSoC journey.

### ðŸ“Œ May 27 - Aug 19 : Coding Period

#### âœ” Task 1 : Introducing Minimal View for Player
The Minimal View in VLC is a simplified interface mode designed to focus on core media playback functions while minimizing distractions when in Player View. Key features include:

- **Compact User Interface:** The interface is streamlined, showing only essential playback controls like play, pause, and volume.
- **Reduced Controls:** Advanced settings and non-critical features like playlists are hidden, ensuring a clutter-free experience.
- **Focus on Content:** The emphasis is on media playback by maximizing screen space and minimizing distractions.
- **Customizable Appearance:** Users can customize which controls remain visible and switch between Minimal View and detailed views.

**Implementation in VLC:**
- **Qt Interface:** Access Minimal View options in VLC Preferences.
- **Keyboard Shortcut:** Activate Minimal View using `Ctrl+H`.
- **View Menu:** Enable Minimal View from the top-right View menu.
- **CLI:** from the Command Line Options using `--qt-minimal-view`
